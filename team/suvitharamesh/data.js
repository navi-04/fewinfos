      "I'm Suvitha Ramesh, a Computer Science Engineering student at M. Kumarasamy College of Engineering with a strong passion for front-end development and user-focused design. After building a solid technical foundation, I began interning at Innoov Japan, where I'm gaining real-world experience while learning Japanese (JLPT N4). I'm also a core member of Fewinfos, a student-led startup focused on innovative tech solutions. Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and UI/UX design, I enjoy blending creativity with technology to build meaningful projects. My leadership experience as part of the Management Committee (MOC) has also helped shape my confidence and teamwork skills. I aim to grow into an independent and impactful tech professional.",
